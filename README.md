## [The Influence of Pyrrhonian Skepticism on Descartes](philosophy/escepticismo_pirronico.pdf)

This essay explores the impact of Pyrrhonian skepticism on Ren√© Descartes' philosophical work, particularly focusing on his famous proposition "cogito ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am). It examines whether Descartes' certainty of the thinking subject successfully overcame the challenges posed by Pyrrhonian skepticism. The work delves into the historical context of skepticism, its main principles as outlined in Sextus Empiricus' "Outlines of Pyrrhonism," and how these ideas became a significant philosophical hurdle for those seeking absolute truths. Through this analysis, the essay contributes to our understanding of epistemology, the nature of knowledge, and the foundations of modern philosophy.
